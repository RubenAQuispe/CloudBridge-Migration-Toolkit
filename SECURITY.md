# Security Policy for CloudBridge Migration Toolkit

## üîí Security Overview

The CloudBridge Migration Toolkit handles sensitive operations including domain credentials, Azure tenant information, and temporary administrative access. Proper security practices are essential for safe deployment.

## üö® Critical Security Requirements

### **1. Configuration Security**

#### **Azure Tenant ID Protection**
- **Never** commit real tenant IDs to version control
- Treat tenant IDs as sensitive organizational data
- Use environment variables or secure configuration management systems in production

#### **Password Security**
- **NEVER** use default passwords in production
- Generate complex passwords with minimum requirements:
  - 15+ characters
  - Mixed case letters (A-Z, a-z)
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Special characters (!@#$%^&*)
  - No dictionary words or predictable patterns

#### **Domain Credentials**
- Use dedicated service accounts with minimal required permissions
- Implement credential rotation policies
- Consider using Managed Service Accounts where possible
- Never store credentials in plain text files

### **2. File System Security**

#### **Configuration Files**
- Restrict access to `MigrationConfig.psd1` to authorized IT staff only
- Use NTFS permissions to limit file access
- Store configuration files outside of user-accessible directories
- Implement file integrity monitoring for configuration changes

#### **Log Files**
- Monitor log files for sensitive information before sharing
- Implement log rotation and secure deletion policies
- Restrict access to log directories
- Consider encrypting logs at rest

### **3. Network Security**

#### **During Migration**
- Ensure secure network connectivity to Azure services
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies during migration
- Use encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) for all Azure communications
- Implement network segmentation where possible

#### **Provisioning Packages**
- Generate provisioning packages in secure environments only
- Validate package integrity before deployment
- Implement secure distribution mechanisms for packages
- Monitor package usage and deployment

## üõ°Ô∏è Deployment Security Best Practices

### **Pre-Deployment**
1. **Security Review**
   - Conduct security review of all configuration files
   - Validate that no sensitive data is exposed
   - Verify proper access controls are in place
   - Test migration process in isolated environment

2. **Credential Management**
   - Use least-privilege principles for all accounts
   - Implement proper credential storage mechanisms
   - Establish credential rotation schedules
   - Document credential recovery procedures

3. **Environment Preparation**
   - Harden deployment systems according to security baselines
   - Implement monitoring and alerting for migration activities
   - Prepare incident response procedures
   - Establish rollback procedures

### **During Deployment**
1. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor all migration activities in real-time
   - Watch for unusual system behavior or errors
   - Track temporary account creation and deletion
   - Monitor network connectivity and Azure service access

2. **Access Control**
   - Limit physical and remote access during migration
   - Use secure administrative channels only
   - Implement change control procedures
   - Document all administrative actions

### **Post-Deployment**
1. **Cleanup**
   - Verify removal of all temporary accounts
   - Secure or remove temporary files
   - Review and secure log files
   - Update security documentation

2. **Validation**
   - Verify successful Azure AD join and Intune enrollment
   - Confirm proper user access and permissions
   - Test security policies and compliance settings
   - Document any security configurations

## üö® Incident Response

### **Security Incident Types**
- Credential exposure or compromise
- Unauthorized access to migration systems
- Failed migrations with security implications
- Network security issues during migration

### **Response Procedures**
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected systems if necessary
   - Secure any exposed credentials
   - Document incident details and timeline
   - Notify appropriate security personnel

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs for security events
   - Determine scope and impact of incident
   - Identify root cause and contributing factors
   - Document findings and recommendations

3. **Recovery**
   - Implement corrective actions
   - Update security procedures as needed
   - Conduct lessons learned session
   - Update incident response documentation

## üìä Security Monitoring

### **Key Metrics to Monitor**
- Failed authentication attempts during migration
- Unusual network traffic patterns
- Temporary account activities and lifecycle
- Configuration file access and modifications
- Migration completion rates and error patterns

### **Alerting Triggers**
- Multiple failed migration attempts
- Unusual access patterns to configuration files
- Network connectivity issues to Azure services
- Temporary account persistence beyond expected timeframe
- BitLocker key escrow failures

## üîß Security Configuration Guidelines

### **PowerShell Security**
- Use constrained PowerShell environments where possible
- Implement PowerShell execution policies
- Monitor PowerShell transcription logs
- Use signed scripts in production environments

### **Windows Security**
- Follow Windows security baselines
- Implement proper audit policies
- Use Windows Defender or equivalent endpoint protection
- Keep systems updated with latest security patches

### **Azure Security**
- Follow Azure security best practices
- Implement Conditional Access policies
- Use Azure AD Identity Protection
- Monitor Azure AD sign-in logs during migration

## üìû Reporting Security Issues

### **Internal Reporting**
- Report security issues to your organization's IT security team
- Follow established incident reporting procedures
- Document all security-related observations
- Escalate critical issues immediately

### **External Reporting**
If you discover security vulnerabilities in this toolkit:
- Create a GitHub issue with security label
- Include detailed reproduction steps
- Provide impact assessment
- Suggest mitigation strategies if known
