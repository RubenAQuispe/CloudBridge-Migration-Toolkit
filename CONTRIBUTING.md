## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- **Bug Reports**: Use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs
- **Feature Requests**: Suggest new features or improvements
- **Security Issues**: Follow our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for reporting vulnerabilities

### Contributing Code

2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. **Make your changes** with clear commit messages
4. **Test thoroughly** in a safe environment
5. **Submit a pull request** with detailed description

## üîí Security Considerations

### **Critical Security Rules**
- **NEVER** commit real credentials, tenant IDs, or sensitive data
- Always use placeholder values in configuration files
- Test security implications of any changes
- Follow the security guidelines in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

### **Configuration Files**
- Only modify template files (`*.template.psd1`)
- Keep actual config files (`MigrationConfig.psd1`) in .gitignore
- Add clear comments for any new configuration options
- Validate that placeholders are obvious and secure

## üìã Development Guidelines

### **Code Standards**
- Follow PowerShell best practices and naming conventions
- Add comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Include error handling and logging
- Maintain compatibility with PowerShell 5.1+

### **Testing Requirements**
- Test all changes in isolated lab environments
- Validate migration scenarios end-to-end
- Verify security controls and access restrictions
- Document test results and scenarios

### **Documentation Standards**
- Update relevant documentation for any changes
- Include clear examples and use cases
- Maintain professional tone and formatting
- Ensure accuracy of technical details

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Development Environment

### **Prerequisites**
- Windows 10/11 with PowerShell 5.1+
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- Git for version control
- Access to Azure AD test tenant (for testing)

### **Development Setup**
1. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/CloudBridge-Migration-Toolkit.git`
2. Create isolated test environment
3. Copy template files for development: `Copy-Item "*.template.psd1" "*.psd1"`
4. Configure with test tenant data
5. Never commit actual configuration files

### **Testing Environment**
- Use dedicated test Azure AD tenant
- Isolated test computers (VMs recommended)
- Network isolation for migration testing
- Backup and restore capabilities
