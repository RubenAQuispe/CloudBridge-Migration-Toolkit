## üîí Security Considerations

### **Critical Security Rules**
- **NEVER** commit real credentials, tenant IDs, or sensitive data
- Always use placeholder values in configuration files
- Test security implications of any changes
- Follow the security guidelines in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

### **Configuration Files**
- Modify `MigrationConfig.psd1` with clear placeholder values
- Ensure placeholders are obvious and secure (e.g., "YOUR-TENANT-ID-HERE")
- Add clear comments for any new configuration options
- Never commit real credentials or tenant-specific data

## üìã Development Guidelines

### **Code Standards**
- Follow PowerShell best practices and naming conventions
- Add comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Include error handling and logging
- Maintain compatibility with PowerShell 5.1+

### **Testing Requirements**
- Test all changes in isolated lab environments
- Validate migration scenarios end-to-end
- Verify security controls and access restrictions
- Document test results and scenarios

### **Documentation Standards**
- Update relevant documentation for any changes
- Include clear examples and use cases
- Maintain professional tone and formatting
- Ensure accuracy of technical details

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Development Environment

### **Prerequisites**
- Windows 10/11 with PowerShell 5.1+
